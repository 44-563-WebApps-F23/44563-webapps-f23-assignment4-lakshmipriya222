    <h2>An Enemy of the People Act 2 Author Henrik Ibsen</h2>
   <p> Dr. Stockmann.</p> 
   <p>You can depend upon it that it is true. Won't you sit
    down?</p>
   <p>(Settles him on the couch.)</p>
   <p>Isn't it a real bit of luck for the town—</p> 
    
   <p> Morten Kiil</p> 
   <p>(suppressing his laughter).</p>
    <p>A bit of luck for the town?</p>
    
    <p>Dr. Stockmann.</p>
    <p> Yes, that I made the discovery in good time</p>
    
   <p> Morten Kiil</p> 
   <p> (as before).</p>
   <p>Yes, yes.
    Yes!—But I should never have
    thought you the sort of man to pull your own brother's leg like this!</p>
    
    <p>Dr. Stockmann.</p>
    <p>Pull his leg!</p> 
    
   <p>Mrs. Stockmann.</p> 
     <p>Really, father dear—</p>
    
    <p>Morten Kiil </p>
   <p> (resting his hands and his chin on the handle of his stick
    and winking slyly at the DOCTOR).</p>
    <p>Let me see, what was the story?
    Some kind of beast that had got into the water-pipes, wasn't it?</p>
